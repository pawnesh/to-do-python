to-do-python
============

It is a python based command line to do program. I made it just for fun and managing my every day task that I have to do because I forget things usually

--add <task name> <end_time> <priority>
--setstatus <task_id> <status>
--view or -v for listing tasks
--remove <task_id> or -r for removing task
